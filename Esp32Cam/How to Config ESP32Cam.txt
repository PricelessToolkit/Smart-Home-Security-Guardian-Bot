Code line: 214 - 245 Stearing Calibration You need to tweak PWM values.

**************************************************************************

Since the resistors on servo controllers  have an "Value error %"
You need to tweak settings ( PWM values "xxxx") so that the left and right mator
spin at the same speed for "Forward" and "backward" and of course in the right direction. . For "LEFT, RIGHT" opposite directions and slower speed.  



   if (Command == "forward")
    {
    steeringAnalogWrite(2, xxxx);
    steeringAnalogWrite(4, xxxx);
    }

   if (Command == "backward")
    {
    steeringAnalogWrite(2, xxxx);
    steeringAnalogWrite(4, xxxx);
    }

    if (Command == "stop")
    {
    steeringAnalogWrite(2, 0);
    steeringAnalogWrite(4, 0);
    }

Thys is for test "this code doesn't work"

And who know how to program like a Jedi, look at the test folder, and if u can please contribute to the project, It will be wonderful.

I think problem is here 

  <script src="jquery-3.5.0.js"></script>
  <script src="mqttws31.min.js"></script>
  <script src="app.js"></script>

import "jquery-3.5.0.js?module";
import "mqttws31.min.js?module";
import "app.js?module";

but UI give me an error
